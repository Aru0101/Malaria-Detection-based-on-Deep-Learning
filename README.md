Problem Statement
Malaria, a deadly disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes, poses a significant global health threat. Manual diagnosis is time-consuming and prone to human error. The challenge is to develop an automated system that accurately detects malaria-infected cells from microscopic images of blood samples. This system aims to:

Improve diagnostic accuracy.
Enable early detection and timely treatment.
Reduce the workload of healthcare professionals and optimize resource allocation.
Solution Approach
The project follows these key steps:

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

Collect diverse datasets of malaria-infected and uninfected blood cell images.
Preprocess images by resizing them to a uniform size and converting them into 4D arrays.
Model Training:

Train the VGG16 model using the preprocessed dataset.
Fine-tune the model's parameters and layers for optimal performance in malaria detection.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model using validation datasets to assess its accuracy, precision, and recall.
Adjust the model and training process based on performance metrics.
Deployment:

Deploy the trained model in a production environment. Ensure compatibility, scalability, and real-time capabilities.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Continuously monitor the model's performance, address biases, and make updates as new data becomes available.
